<h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
<p>My main interest in IT would be computer hardware. As I undertake system integration for customers, keeping up to date with current hardware <br>
options is a must. I thoroughly enjoy keeping track of the latest hardware options for PC’s, i.e. Nvidia’s recent announcement regarding the <br>
release of the RTX 3000 series graphic’s processing units.</p>
<h3>When did my interest in IT start?</h3>
<p>My interest in IT began approximately around the age of 7. I was given a small DYI build a computer kit for my birthday and I genuinely enjoyed it. <br>
Since then I started building and upgrading PC’s as a hobby, which turned into a side job later in life. My experience in IT has mostly been limited <br>
to the hardware side of the industry. I believe I have extensive knowledge when it comes to designing and building PC’s.</p>
<h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I left my previous employment as a technician at Warrnambool Toyota because I wanted to pursue a career in IT. My initial plan was to do my <br>
certificate III in IT through TAFE, but I decided it would be better for myself and my future to explore higher education options, thus ultimately <br>
leading me to RMIT.</p>
<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p>What I expect to learn from my studies is not only how the IT industry functions but to be able tackle issues related to the IT field and apply <br>
problem solving techniques to resolve them. I have only just begun to understand how massive the IT industry is and to be able to walk away from my <br>
studies with a fraction of that knowledge would be incredible.</p>
<br>
<h3>My ideal job</h3>
<p>My ideal job would to be an operating system engineer. The role requirements for this job are a bachelor’s degree in IT but ideally, I would prefer <br>
to further my studies before undertaking this role. Personally, I would like to complete my master’s degree of Information Technology to further my <br>
knowledge in the field. <br>
The operating system engineer role links my passion for computer hardware with the software requirements of operating systems. I have some amount of <br>
knowledge of the hardware requirements for some specialised systems such as NAS, raid setups, server hardware, etc but I lack the knowledge needed <br>
to perform troubleshooting and diagnosis of the software systems. <br>
Some of the jobs required to be performed by an operating system engineer are as follows; <br>
•	To plan and update hardware and software changes within existing installations or create new ones <br>
•	Research network infrastructure configurations to understand their requirements and demands <br>
•	Provide ongoing technical support as well as maintenance and troubleshooting to the end user </p>

<br>
<h3>What do the results of these tests mean?</h3>
<p>The results of the above tests were very consistent based on how I work and interact with those around me. I am acutely aware of my weak points when <br>
it comes these tests as it is something I have been aiming to improve upon after my time in the military.</p>
<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
<p>These results may end up having a negative impact on certain types of required teamwork. I am a very dominant personality and work better when I <br>
oversee a group. If another member of my group has a similar personality type to myself, we would end up clashing and not being productive.</p>
<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>Ideally, I would be in a group where I could delegate tasks to those who were best fitted for that role, while also providing my own input in other <br>
areas. If I am unable to fill the role, I am best suited to, I understand the requirement to adapt to my group’s needs.</p>
<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<p>A computer hardware-based webstore that has a linked mobile phone application that allows, PC enthusiasts, server engineer’s and novices alike, to build <br>
their desired systems from both a website as well as on the go from a mobile phone application. The goal of my application is to allow any hardware build to be <br>
undertaken anywhere. This application would facilitate those who are on the job as well as those enthusiasts who are out looking to build a new PC. It includes <br>
functions such as building PC systems, building server systems, showing power requirements for systems builds, build guides for first time builders, etc.</p>
<p>As far as my research has lead me, there are only two PC hardware building applications available <br>
(Google play store, PC Builder - Part Picker & Generate Builds!; Apple Store, BuildCores: PC Parts & Builds). Both these applications are limited by the region <br>
they are developed and locked to. They are also limited to buying their parts from third party online suppliers such as Amazon and Newegg, which the Australian <br>
versions of these sites have very limited functionality and stock for buying PC components. While not an inherently bad feature, having direct supply to a <br>
manufacturer would be far more efficient. My vision of a PC building application would circumvent the issues with regional availability and act as an online store <br>
with direct links to all necessary hardware manufacturers.</p>
<p>The focus is to launch the application for end users to allow them to build what they desire on the go; however, I believe this would be counter-intuitive without <br>
a website to be paired with the application. This would allow server engineers who are either upgrading or building a new system to build a system on their phone and <br>
send it to whoever necessary for approval, reducing project downtime. This function of the application would also allow the sending of a quote to a client in the form <br>
of a parts list and breakdown of the items required. <br>
The application isn’t just focused at the working professional but also at D.I.Y hobbyists and PC enthusiasts. A first time PC builder can use this application to help <br>
them through their build step by step, with both a detailed instruction set and a forum with advice from seasoned professionals. They may not have access to a laptop <br>
or another PC to get help when building their system, but most users will have access to a smartphone, where this application comes in handy. Easy to follow step by <br>
step instructions and video tutorials are easily accessible via the application. <br>
The PC enthusiast can take advantage of this application by building their current PC setup, then upgrading the components of their choice to see if they will be <br>
compatible with their current build. The information that will be displayed for them will include cost to performance upgrade, increase or decrease in required power <br>
draw and compatibility of the hardware components. <br>
Many of the current website-based PC building tools have some of these functions but lack certain other functionalities. It makes building a PC for the first time <br>
quite confusing as there is a lot of information to understand before undertaking a new build, which usually requires going to several different websites to gain the <br>
information necessary. This application is an all-encompassing build guide to help all levels of system integrators to complete their builds from start to finish.</p>
